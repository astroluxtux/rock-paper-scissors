        <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to an exciting rendition of the childhood classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" In this version, you will be playing against the computer. The winner will be the player who wins the most of 5 rounds.</p>
        <h2>Rules for the Game</h2>
        <p>1. Pick from the following selection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rock</li>
            <li>Paper</li>
            <li>Scissors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Each choice will determine which player wins that round. The possible outcomes are below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rock vs. Paper = Paper wins. Paper covers Rock.</li>
            <li>Rock vs. Scissors = Rock wins. Rock breaks Scissors</li>
            <li>Paper vs. Scissors = Scissors wins. Scissors cuts Paper.</li>
            <li>Ties are possible when two of the same choices are selected for that round. In that case, a new round will be played until a winner is determined.</li>
